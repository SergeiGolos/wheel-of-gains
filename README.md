### For Developers

#### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: v20.19.4+ (tested version, see [engines](./package.json))
- **npm**: 10.8.2+ (latest stable recommended)

#### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SergeiGolos/wheel-of-gains.git
   cd wheel-of-gains
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** (takes ~60 seconds, expect deprecated warnings):

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open in browser**:
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173/wheel-of-gains/`

#### Development Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev               # Start dev server (localhost:5173/wheel-of-gains/)
npm run start            # Alternative dev server with auto-open

# Code Quality
npm run fmt              # Format code with Prettier (5 seconds)
npm run fmt.check        # Check formatting without changes
npm run lint             # ESLint code checking (2 seconds)

# Building & Testing
npm run build            # Build for production (10 seconds)
npm run preview          # Preview production build (localhost:4173/wheel-of-gains/)
npm run build.types      # TypeScript type checking

# Testing & Quality Assurance
npm run test:playwright        # Run Playwright tests
npm run test:playwright:ui     # Run tests with UI mode
npm run test:playwright:headed # Run tests with browser visible
npm run analyze               # Generate code complexity analysis

# Storybook (Component Documentation & Testing)
npm run storybook            # Start Storybook dev server (localhost:6006)
npm run build-storybook      # Build Storybook for production
npm run playwright:install   # Install Playwright browsers (for CI/CD)
```

#### Development Workflow

1. **Before starting**: Run `npm run fmt && npm run lint` to establish clean baseline
2. **During development**: Keep `npm run dev` running for hot reload
3. **Before committing**:
   - `npm run fmt` - Format all code
   - `npm run lint` - Check for errors
   - `npm run build` - Verify production build works
   - Test core functionality manually by spinning the wheel

#### Testing Strategy

The project uses comprehensive testing with:

- **Storybook**: Component documentation and interactive testing
- **Playwright**: End-to-end testing of component behavior
- **Manual Testing**: Core wheel functionality validation
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated testing on every push/PR

See [TESTING.md](./TESTING.md) for detailed testing documentation.

### üìä Code Complexity Analysis

This project includes automated complexity analysis to help maintain code quality:

```bash
npm run analyze
```

This generates a comprehensive `COMPLEXITY_ANALYSIS.md` report that identifies:

- High complexity components that may need refactoring
- Detailed metrics for each file (lines of code, functions, dependencies)
- Recommendations for improving code maintainability

The analysis is particularly useful for this "heavily vibe coded" project to identify technical debt and prioritize refactoring efforts.
