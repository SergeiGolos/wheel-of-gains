- Needed to persist spin history
- Required offline capability
- No server-side infrastructure available

**Decision**:
- Use browser localStorage for data persistence
- Implement workout management with CRUD operations
- Store spin history with timestamps
- Provide import/export functionality

**Consequences**:
- ‚úÖ No server infrastructure required
- ‚úÖ Offline functionality
- ‚úÖ Fast data access
- ‚úÖ User-specific customizations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Data limited to single browser/device
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Data can be lost if browser storage is cleared

## ADR-005: Storybook for Component Documentation and Testing

**Status**: Accepted (Issues #61, #65, August 2025)

**Context**:
- Growing component library needed documentation
- Manual testing was becoming difficult
- Needed visual regression testing capability
- Required component development in isolation

**Decision**:
- Implement Storybook 8.x (upgrade to 9.x had compatibility issues)
- Create comprehensive stories for all components
- Integrate Playwright for automated testing
- Deploy Storybook alongside main application

**Consequences**:
- ‚úÖ Visual component documentation
- ‚úÖ Component development in isolation
- ‚úÖ Interactive testing capabilities
- ‚úÖ Automated visual regression testing
- ‚úÖ Better developer experience
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Additional build complexity
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Maintenance overhead for stories

## ADR-006: Comprehensive CI/CD Pipeline with Automated Testing

**Status**: Accepted (Issues #71, #80, #84, August 2025)

**Context**:
- Manual testing was insufficient for growing codebase
- Needed reliable deployment pipeline
- Required quality gates before production
- Multiple contributors needed consistent testing

**Decision**:
- Implement GitHub Actions workflow with three jobs: test, build, deploy
- Block deployment if tests fail
- Use Playwright for component testing via Storybook
- Generate build artifacts with version information
- Integrate Storybook deployment with main application

**Consequences**:
- ‚úÖ Reliable automated deployments
- ‚úÖ Quality gates prevent broken releases
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test coverage
- ‚úÖ Version tracking and artifact management
- ‚úÖ Developer confidence in changes
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Longer deployment times due to testing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Increased CI/CD complexity

**Status**: Accepted (Issue #54, August 2025)

**Context**:
- Users wanted to share custom workout configurations
- Needed way to encode complex workout data in URLs
- Required backward compatibility with existing features

**Decision**:
- Implement base64 + gzip compression for workout data
- Create `/zip` route that accepts compressed data in query parameters
- Maintain separate encoding/decoding utilities
- Generate test collections for validation

**Consequences**:
- ‚úÖ Shareable workout configurations via URLs
- ‚úÖ Compact data representation
- ‚úÖ No server storage required
- ‚úÖ Backward compatible with existing features
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Complex encoding/decoding logic
- ‚ö†Ô∏è URL length limitations for very large datasets

## ADR-008: Code Quality and Complexity Management

**Status**: Accepted (Issue #55, August 2025)

**Context**:
- Project described as "heavily vibe coded"
- Technical debt accumulating
- Needed objective code quality metrics
- Required refactoring guidance

## Deprecated Decisions

### ~~ADR-009: Jest + React Testing Library~~

**Status**: Superseded by ADR-005 (Storybook + Playwright)

**Context**: Initially planned to use Jest for testing

**Decision**: Superseded by Storybook + Playwright approach which provides better visual testing and component documentation

## Future Architectural Considerations

### Under Consideration

1. **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Offline capabilities and mobile app-like experience
2. **Analytics Integration**: User behavior tracking and performance monitoring  
3. **Social Features**: Workout sharing and community features
4. **Timer Integration**: Built-in workout timing functionality
5. **Backend API**: User accounts and cross-device synchronization

### Constraints

- **GitHub Pages Deployment**: Static site generation required
- **No Server Costs**: Solutions must work without server infrastructure
- **Browser Compatibility**: Must work across modern browsers
- **Mobile Responsive**: Touch-friendly interface required

## Decision Making Process

1. **Issue Creation**: Technical decisions start as GitHub issues
2. **Research & Discussion**: Explore alternatives and trade-offs
3. **Prototyping**: Test approaches when needed
4. **Documentation**: Record decision and rationale
5. **Implementation**: Execute with monitoring for consequences
6. **Review**: Evaluate outcomes and adjust if needed
